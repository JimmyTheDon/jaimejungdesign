        <h2>MATRIX</h2>
        <p>The city of Gilroy is entering a revival with the routing of the California High Speed Rail. this will create opportunities to reinvigorate the 19th Century urban heart of this small rural city. The Matrix has the potential to invigorate the economic situation in Gilroy as well as sponsor a substatial growth in population. With the arrival of the high speed train, the site will serve as a focal point for future development. This project requires that we understand the impact of such a project in a city like Gilroy. to take full advantage of the site, we have adopted the air rights above the track. Railroads dramatically use bridges to soar above obstacles. we have taken this concept and elevated our project within a bridge-like mega truss above the parallel rail lines below to free up the surrounding site for future redevelopment.</p>

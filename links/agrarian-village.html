    <h2>AGRARIAN VILLAGE</h2>
    <p>
        The Oakland Coliseum site near the San Leandro Bay requires intervention in order
        to ensure it’s resilience to climate change. Agrarian Village tackles ecological, 
        urban, and social issues present on this site through a strategy that phases itself 
        from 2020 through 2080. A main component of this strategy is the economic catalyst 
        that was chosen in order to ensure growth on the site: Marijuana Cultivation. 
        Agrarian Village’s mater planning focuses on how to design a new typology of 
        marijuana cultivation and communal living through managing the surrounding landscape 
        and implementing new systems around it.

        Agrarian Village’s living scale promotes community cultivation through small-scaled 
        agriculture and collective housing. At the urban block scale, there is 60% permeability 
        for light to enter the underneath surface, one portion of this being the courtyard. 
        The courtyard is the intermediate level between the ecological and cultivation realm 
        below, and the collective atmosphere above. On the third level surface, there is 25% 
        collective space, 25% gardens, and 50% living units.
